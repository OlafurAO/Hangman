Rules


When you've guessed a word correctly you get 100 points. However, for
each wrong guess, 10 points get redacted.

Tips:
type '-' when guessing a character in the game. This allows you to guess 
the whole word.	If you guess correctly, you win but if you guess incorrectly,
you lose, regardless of how many tries remain

Spaces are not allowed. As a result, when you add a word to the 
database, you shouldn't input words such as bicycle helmet. Also, inputting an actual
word with correct spelling is the player's responsibility

The game is case sensitive, so keep that in mind when adding a new word.
All the preloaded words are in lowercase so make sure you keep your words
in lowercase as well :)
